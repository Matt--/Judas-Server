&nbsp&nbspFind it under Judas-Server/views/testpage.html and do as you please with it.<br>
&nbsp&nbspYou cannot break the server :-)<br><br>

 /matt     ...alternate test, will return a string starting with \"Matt\" and saying something random.<br>
 /error/xxx   ... where xxx is your http error code to be tested. Returns text \"Error : xxx\" with a header file that contains the same error. Don't rely on my text, use the header file.<br>
